                    <b>The Circulatory System</b> is the entire system in the body which works with blood and the nutrients in it.  It makes sure that muscles get the necessary nutrients and oxygen for them to function.  It also carries waste products back to the center of the body, where gaseous waste like CO2 is breathed out and other wastes are passed through the excretory system

Usually from the heart, blood is either sent throughout the body (when it's oxygenated) or to the lungs (when it's deoxygenated)</figcaption></section>

                    <b>Arteries</b> carry blood away from the heart, and arteries branch into smaller vessels called the <b>arterioles</b>. These arteries and arterioles have thick cell walls to support the high blood pressure and provide strength. Also are very narrow in diameter and are elastic, which helps maintain homeostasis of blood pressure. Most arteries, except for the pulmonary artery, carry oxygenated blood to throughout the body to support metabolic functions.

                <p>
                    Eventually the arterioles branch into tiny <b>capillaries</b>, where nutrient exchange occurs and eventually recombine with other vessels that exit capillaries to form venules.

                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Venules</b> merge into a vein, a larger blood vessel, that returns the deoxygenated blood to the heart. <b>Veins</b> have thinner walls and travel back to the heart with relatively slow velocity and low pressure. The blood flows through the contractions of the skeletal muscles and flows one-way directions due to <b>one-way valves</b>. 

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Both Arteries and veins transport blood in two separate circuits, the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit.  Arteries in the systemic circuit provide blood with high contents of oxygen to various tissues inside the body.  Therefore because of this, the blood returned to the heart through systematic veins have less oxygen and is said to be <b>Deoxygenated Blood</b>, because the oxygen carried has been delivered to cells.  On the contrary in the Pulmonary circuit, low oxygenated blood is carried by arteries solely to the lungs for gas exchange.  After gas exchange by the lungs the blood becomes freshly oxygenated, and pulmonary veins circulate this blood back towards the heart.
