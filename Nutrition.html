                    A healthy diet is a major factor in reducing risks to heart disease and heart attacks.  Suitable diets mainly revolve on the general idea to limit bad cholesterol and fat uptake.  Generally speaking, it is essential to have about 5 servings of fruits and vegetables; this increases the uptake in fiber, vitamins, and minerals while containing a minimal amount of sodium and cholesterol.  Fruit and vegetables contain components that protect against heart disease and stroke.

                    A steady carbohydrate diet of whole grains also increase the uptake of vitamins, iron, and fiber and are low in cholesterol.  Also, unrefined grains contain folic acid which is another important protector against heart disease.  Soy actually has a beneficial effect on blood lipid levels. Forty seven grams of soy protein a day will lead to a 9% drop in total cholesterol and an additional 13% drop in lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL).

                    The ultimate risk factor for coronary artery disease and heart attack, etc  is abnormal blood lipid levels.  High levels of saturated and transfat, often found in unhealthy foods such as cakes, and cookies, will lead to an abnormal level in cholesterol levels.  This will cause the buildup of plaque and artery damage, and the arteries eventually become narrower.  This ultimately leads to the formation of blood clots and increased blood rupture.  The clogging of arteries leads to many severe symptoms.
