                    Veins deposit deoxygenated blood, since much of the oxygen has been extracted by the tissues, and wastes such as carbon dioxide was picked up.  This becomes transported into the <b>inferior vena cava</b> and to the <b>superior vena cava</b>. Blood then flows through to the <b>right atrium</b>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Blood then moves into the <b>right ventricle</b> via the <b>right atrioventricular valve</b> (also referred to as  AV valve and tricuspid valve). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The ventricles, with walls thicker and more muscular than those of the atriums, pump the deoxygenated blood to the <b>pulmonary artery</b> through the the <b>pulmonary semilunar valve</b>. A mechanism to regulate blood flow is the <em>contraction</em> of the ventricle, which causes the AV valve to close and prevent backflow of blood to the <em>atrium</em>. When the ventricle <em>relaxes</em>, the semilunar valve closes to prevent backflow into the <em>ventricle</em>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This deoxygenated blood enters the vessels which branch to supply blood to pulmonary capillaries where <b>gas exchange</b> occurs within the lungs.  Previously deoxygenated, the blood now becomes <b>rich in oxygen</b> concentration. This newly oxygenated blood returns from the pulmonary circuit to the <b>left atrium</b> via the <b>pulmonary veins</b>.  From the left atrium, the oxygenated blood flows to the <b>left ventricle</b>, which then becomes pumped into the <b>aorta</b>.  The Aorta then sends the blood to its branches: the systemic arteries.  This oxygen rich blood will then be sent to every organ of the body.  Through this means, the blood becomes depleted and used of its oxygen content. Deoxygenated, this blood will  be taken again by the pulmonary circuit, and the entire process begins again.
