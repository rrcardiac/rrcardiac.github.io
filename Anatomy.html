                    Veins deposit deoxygenated blood, since much of the oxygen has been extracted by the tissues, and wastes such as carbon dioxide was picked up.  This becomes transported into the <b>inferior vena cava</b> and to the <b>superior vena cava</b>. Blood then flows through to the <b>right atrium</b>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Blood then moves into the <b>right ventricle</b> via the <b>right atrioventricular valve</b> (also referred to as  AV valve and tricuspid valve). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The ventricles, with walls thicker and more muscular than those of the atriums, pump the deoxygenated blood to the <b>pulmonary artery</b> through the the <b>pulmonary semilunar valve</b>. A mechanism to regulate blood flow is the <em>contraction</em> of the ventricle, which causes the AV valve to close and prevent backflow of blood to the <em>atrium</em>. When the ventricle <em>relaxes</em>, the semilunar valve closes to prevent backflow into the <em>ventricle</em>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This deoxygenated blood enters the vessels which branch to supply blood to pulmonary capillaries where <b>gas exchange</b> occurs within the lungs.  Previously deoxygenated, the blood now becomes <b>rich in oxygen</b> concentration. This newly oxygenated blood returns from the pulmonary circuit to the <b>left atrium</b> via the <b>pulmonary veins</b>.  From the left atrium, the oxygenated blood flows to the <b>left ventricle</b>, which then becomes pumped into the <b>aorta</b>.  The Aorta then sends the blood to its branches: the systemic arteries.  This oxygen rich blood will then be sent to every organ of the body.  Through this means, the blood becomes depleted and used of its oxygen content. Deoxygenated, this blood will  be taken again by the pulmonary circuit, and the entire process begins again.

                <h1 class = "heady">The Cardiac Cycle</h1>
                <p>The Cardiac Cycle is the period of time which begins with the contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation.  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The period of contraction while blood is pumped out of the heart and into circulation is called <b>systole</b></li>
                    <li>The period of relaxation that happens when chambers fill up with blood is known <b>diastole</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The atria and the ventricles undergo these two processes, which are carefully regulated and coordinated to ensure blood is pumped efficiently to the body.</li>
                            <li>
                                The cardiac cycle is driven by <b>pressure</b>
Fluids, in this case blood, are materials that flow according to pressure gradients.  They move from regions with higher pressure to lower pressure. Therefore when chambers are in the diastole, blood flows into the atria from the veins (which are higher in pressure). As blood flows into the atria pressure rises, therefore the movement of blood throughout the heart from the atria to the ventricles is a <b>passive</b> process initially.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
