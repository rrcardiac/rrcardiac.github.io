                <ul>
                    <p>Blood is a connective tissue.  It is comprised of cellular elements and an extracellular matrix.</p>
                    <p>The main function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and to remove wastes from somatic cells.  However this is just a surface level description of the importance of blood.</p>
                    <p>Other key functions include:<p></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Transportation</b>: Nutrients from foods are absorbed in the digestive tract, most of these travel in the bloodstream.  Oxygen from the air taken in from breathing and diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart.  Also, endocrine glands are scattered throughout the body release hormones in the bloodstream to procure a variety of responses.</li>
                            <li><b>Defense</b>: White blood cells protect the bodies from external threats such as disease-causing bacteria which may enter the bloodstream.</li>
                            <li><b>Maintainance of Homeostasis</b>: A good example is temperature regulation, it is a negative feedback loop.  For example during exercise, body temperature rises--in order for the body to maintain homeostasis and revert this., the body triggers to increase transport of blood from your core to your periphery.  This cools the body as external heat will be dissipated to the environment, therefore returning blood will be cooler.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
