                <h1 class = "heady">Atherosclerosis</h1>
                <p>
                    Atherosclerosis is a disease that affects developed arteries. A waxy substance called plaque, which contains lipids, fats, cholesterol, and calcium,  builds up in the arteries (which carry oxygen rich blood, to your body).As a result, this reduces the blood flow in your heart as the plaque congests the arteries, and this can lead to blood clotting (accumulation of blood clots can partially or completely prevent blood flow).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A normal artery is flexible, however the buildup of plaque reduces its flexibility and narrows its diameter. This can lead to serious heart problems, such as heart attacks and stroke, and even death.

                <br>    
                <p>Atherosclerosis has been known to cause Coronary Heart Disease, Carotid Artery Disease, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease, which are other conditions that cause the heart to malfunction</p>
                
                <h1 class = "heady">Atrial Fibrillation</h1>
                <p>
                    Atrial fibrillation is a condition that disrupts your heartbeat. A glitch in the heartâ€™s electrical system makes its upper chambers (the atria) beat so fast they quiver, or fibrillate. This causes the lower chambers (the ventricles) to beat out of sync.
                </p>

                        <figcaption>Differences in Heartbeats for a Normal Heart Compared to a Heart with Atrial Fibrillation</figcaption>
                    </section>
                </figure>
                
                <p>The condition has two major effects</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increased chance for heart failiure</li>
                    <li>Increased chance for stroke
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the Heart is not pumping normally, slow moving blood results.  This increases formation of blood clots.  A stroke results when a clot travels to the brain.  Afib increases the chances of this by almost 5 times</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <figure>
                    <section class = "centered" style = "width: 40vw;">
                        <img class = "centered" src = "images/afib.png" />
                        <figcaption>An illustration of the clotting caused by AFib</figcaption>
                    </section>
                </figure>
                <p>Usually the atria and ventricles work together so the heart pumps blood in steady rhythm. But in AFib, they don't. The irregular beats can cause a fast, fluttering heart rate -- 100-175 beats per minute -- instead of the normal 60-100 beats per minute.</p>
                <p>Warning Signs: Uneven Pulse, Chest Pains, and Shortness of Breath</p>
                <p>Afib will disrupt blood flow to the rest of the body, therefore dizziness, breathlessness, and fatigue are often observed</p>
                
                <p>Risk Factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
                    <li>Coronary Artery Disease</li>
                    <li>Heart Failiure</li>
                    <li>Valve Problems</li>
                    <li>Thyroid Disorders</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although many risk factors are hereditary, they can be suppressed through healthy eating habits as well as the obvious set of precautions; eliminate smoking and the uptake of illegal drugs and stimulants.</p>
                
                <h1 class = "heady">Ventricular Tachycardia</h1>
                <p>This disease is like Atrial Fibrillation except that it occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Ventricular tachycardia is a fast but regular rhythm. It can lead to ventricular fibrillation, which is fast and irregular. With ventricular fibrillation, the heartbeats are so fast and irregular that the heart stops pumping blood.</p>
                
                <p>Mainly caused by other Heart conditions, such as heart attacks and congenital heart defects.  Occasionally open heart surgery may cause such irregular rhythm, as well as an electrolyte imbalance.  Lastly, stimulants such as cocaine may trigger Tachycardia symptoms.</p>
                <p>Symptoms</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Palpations</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Chest Pains</li>
                    <li>Syncope</li>
                    <li>Weak Pulse</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These symptoms can lead to sudden death</p>
